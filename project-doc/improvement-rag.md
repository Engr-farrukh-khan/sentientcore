As now, the order of tasks are not sequential and unmanageable, I mean are there any monitor agent or assistant one that can monitor the whole flow of conversation that may having back-and-forth modification and manipulation from user and also I want to have all tasks' actions carried by specialized agents being monitored and verbose into front-end and these must be finished before another can take place. And there must be a clear session to restart from the beginning. So let's take an example to make clear of how these should be like, starting from something very vague (and the conversation will be in charge by orchestrator with user). In my imagination there should be a very robust design of agents, graphs - sub-graphs and nodes, tools, and states  and memory (short vs long-term memory) using what we currently have Groq API, Google Gemini API (we can use OpenAI compatibility for less hassle), Lang Graph, Lang Chain, Pandytic, and external search service either Tavily or Exa but preferably any free services that you can offer; and E2B for code interpreter, computer use, stream and render preview front end. The system is highly autonomous and must handle the hassle of asking for too technical details from user but address multiple tasks (not necessarily to build an app), across multiple industries, departments, positions of job, and regardless of technical expertise.

## In-charge agents
- Ultra orchestrator with assistant: will handle the conversation from user (regardless of language input it will response in regarded language); assign tasks; using all supported tools and can even set up a new specialized agent for edge cases 
	- This agent understand the flow very thoroughly to self decide on which agents to handle the up-coming tasks, derive to which sub-graph and in which orders
	- This agent can mange to direct users from off-topic conversation, prevent exploitation from the user if not used in the correct purpose (for example after 7 turns of conversation but going nowhere will warn the user and reset conversation; and the 2nd time this happens will ban user IP for 1 hour of using the service)
	- This agent can understand image and documents so make sure to use one with vision enabled model
	- this agent can understand voice input again make sure to prepare models with capability to understand audio 
	- This agent can also help with gradually making user's request more elaborative, detailed, accurate and sufficient to enough deriving into overview plans for latter tasks and graphs
	- This agent can self decide when to use search tool itself to understand more about the request, or to correct user's inaccurate requests due to wrong uses
	- This agent and his assistant self decide on when it is enough to break-down into assigned tasks for specialized agent and their sub-graphs
	- This agent and his assistant can self decide on when and how to create new specialized agent and design new sub-graphs for edge cases
	- prepare fallback with multiple models from both Groq API (3.3 llama, 4.0 llama and other models ) and , Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash)
	- The agent is equipped with lightweight database to be in charge of whole conversation and actions/state and results from other agents and graphs
- Research agent: in charge of researching tasks - still in development but this agent will handle different kinds of research and manage the research sub-graph - the research techniques can be multi-steps needing consolidation, validation etc (you can advice to make this more robust). Some of the research job can be listed like 
	- Knowledge research: understood the entry to build sequences of research terms and consolidation to a comprehensive and hierarchical report
	- Deep-research: a more fine-tuning of the above but more steps, more reasoning in between, multiple sources , more robust and enhance sub-steps and of course the final report is lengthier and dive deep down
	- Best-in-class: this is more for tech stacks evaluation and reasoning to pick the combination of stacks suitable for build-app job
- Architect planner agent: still in development but in general will work collaboratively with research, front-end and back-end developer can consolidate, reasoning, synthesize knowledge to produce High-level plan, PRD, product tech specification, action plans in detail, break-down build tasks etc. And architect planner can distribute these plans into long-term build 4 layers of memory that is hierarchical, chunked, indexed, vectorized, categorized and relational to facilitate development
	- The 4 layers of long term memories are:
		- Knowledge documents synthesis
		- Build conversation between user and agent developer
		- codebase knowledge
		- stack and dependencies documents
- front-end developer agent: still in development but make it ready to connect with its sub-graph, this work collaboratively with architect planner and research agent and back-end agent. highly capable of front-end design tasks
- back-end development agent: still in development and similar to the above but handle back-end tasks and work closely to front-end developer
- coding agent: will work under both front-end and back-end developer to work for which sub-graph and tasks that he is assigned to
- a monitoring agent to understand the back and forth flow in main graph and sub-graphs to call orchestrator to follow up and to regulate the whole process and the states 

## Graphs and sub-graphs and states
these knowledges are still brand new to me but my understand is these may include very robust specialized flow and conditions for the above agents to fulfil their tasks they can include graph like

- Orchestrator graph
- project architecture graph
- research, report and knowledge synthesis graph
- front-end graph (including mockup, wireframe, prototype app, and development stages)
- back-end graph (including back-end architect proposal, back-end development execution plan etc)
- the build graph: this may inclde the actual build that step by step take place with rigid monitoring and collaborative work between front and back and with modification from user too

Because this is a highly autonomous multi-agent RAG system so there must be a robust back and forth between user, agents, graphs and sub-graphs and states, models, tools uses. Though it is still just a walk me through step in which from user input  the end expectation is ready-to-push to database of 4 memory layer knowledgebases that sufficient for a hierarchical and sequential build steps take place for latter. In between of these there will be various in-depth build documents, data analysis, mini-app and prototypes that are in artifacts form to be able to download, rendered to front end (NextJS prototypes, streamlit app, gladio app, python flash etc)  and ready to view and decide by users.

So which all the nuances and complexity as describe above this is  an example in terms of conversation take place which occure all agents, sub-graph, sophistication of states managements, memory uses and back-and forth tasks passing, collaboration not only between agents themselves but between the user (to modify and manipulate to make orchestrator back-and forth execute his decision, and assign tasks and graphs etc) with agent

Of course. Here is a detailed, conversational example of how the highly autonomous multi-agent RAG system you described could work, starting with a user's vague request and demonstrating the interaction between the various components.

### The Conversational Flow:

**User:** I want a solution for my weak English.

**Orchestrator:** (Utilizing a Gemini 2.5 Flash model for its multimodal and language understanding capabilities)

"I understand you're looking for a solution to improve your English. To provide you with the best possible options, could you tell me a bit more about what you're struggling with? For example, are you having trouble with speaking, writing, listening, or reading? Also, what are your goals for improving your English? Are you a student, a professional, or are you learning for personal reasons?"

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The **Ultra Orchestrator** agent is activated, and the conversation is logged in its lightweight database.
*   The initial state of the **Orchestrator Graph** is set to "clarifying_request."
*   The Orchestrator recognizes the vagueness of the request and, instead of immediately assigning tasks, it engages in a dialogue to gather more information.

**User:** I am a software developer and I have trouble with writing clear documentation and communicating with my colleagues in English.

**Orchestrator:** "Thank you for the clarification. It sounds like you need a solution focused on professional writing and communication skills for a software developer. I can help with that. I will initiate a research and planning process to devise a personalized solution for you. This will involve a few specialized agents working together. You'll be able to see their progress and provide feedback along the way."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The Orchestrator updates the state of the Orchestrator Graph to "research_and_planning."
*   It then triggers the **Research Agent** and passes the user's request and the clarified context to the **Research, Report, and Knowledge Synthesis Graph.**

**Monitoring Agent:** (Verbose output to the front-end)
"Orchestrator has initiated the Research Agent. The goal is to find the best solutions for a software developer to improve their professional English writing and communication skills. The Research Agent will now begin its work in the Research, Report, and Knowledge Synthesis Graph."

**Research Agent:** (Inside the Research, Report, and Knowledge Synthesis Graph)
"I will now conduct research to identify the best methods, tools, and resources for a software developer to improve their professional English. I will start by performing a knowledge research to build a foundational understanding and then consolidate the findings into a report."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The Research Agent, using a Llama 3.3 model via the Groq API for speed, starts the "knowledge_research" sub-task.
*   It uses the **Tavily search API** to find relevant articles, courses, and tools. The search queries might include: "professional English for software developers," "technical writing courses for non-native English speakers," "improving communication skills for remote developers."
*   The search results are processed, and the key findings are synthesized and stored in the first layer of the long-term memory: **Knowledge documents synthesis.**

**Monitoring Agent:** (Verbose output to the front-end)
"The Research Agent has completed its initial research and has identified several potential solutions, including online courses, AI-powered writing assistants, and communication workshops. The agent will now proceed to the deep-research phase to evaluate these options in more detail."

**Research Agent:** "I will now perform a deep-research to evaluate the identified solutions. This will involve analyzing user reviews, comparing pricing and features, and identifying the best-in-class options for your specific needs."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The Research Agent continues within the Research, Report, and Knowledge Synthesis Graph, moving to the "deep_research" sub-task.
*   It uses the **Exa search API** to find more specific information, such as user reviews on forums like Reddit and comparisons of different AI writing tools.
*   The agent might also use the **E2B code interpreter** to run a simple script that scrapes and analyzes the pricing and features of different online courses.
*   The synthesized findings are added to the **Knowledge documents synthesis** memory layer.

**Architect Planner Agent:** (Activated by the Orchestrator after the research phase)
"Based on the research, I will now create a high-level plan and a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a personalized solution for you. This will include a combination of an AI-powered writing assistant and a series of interactive exercises to practice your communication skills."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The Orchestrator, seeing the completion of the research phase in the Monitoring Agent's output, activates the **Architect Planner Agent** and transitions to the **Project Architecture Graph.**
*   The Architect Planner Agent, using a Gemini 2.0 Flash model, synthesizes the research findings and begins to formulate a plan.
*   The plan and PRD are stored in the second layer of the long-term memory: **Build conversation between user and agent developer.**

**User:** This sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the AI-powered writing assistant?

**Orchestrator:** "Of course. The Architect Planner Agent has proposed an AI assistant that would integrate with your code editor. It would provide real-time feedback on your writing, suggest improvements for clarity and conciseness, and help you with technical vocabulary. Would you like to see a prototype of how this might work?"

**User:** Yes, please.

**Orchestrator:** "Great. I will now assign the task of creating a prototype to the Front-end and Back-end Developer Agents."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The Orchestrator updates the state of the Orchestrator Graph to "prototyping."
*   It activates the **Front-end and Back-end Developer Agents** and transitions to the **Build Graph.**
*   The relevant information from the long-term memory is passed to these agents.

**Front-end Developer Agent:** (Working in the Front-end Graph)
"I will now create a simple web-based interface that simulates the AI writing assistant. I will use Next.js to create the prototype and render it for you to interact with."

**Back-end Developer Agent:** (Working in the Back-end Graph)
"I will create a simple Flask backend that will power the prototype. It will take your text as input and use a fine-tuned Llama 3.3 model (via Groq API) to provide writing suggestions."

**Coding Agent:** (Working under the developer agents)
"I will now write the necessary code for the front-end and back-end of the prototype. I will use the **E2B code interpreter** to test the code in a sandboxed environment to ensure it is working correctly."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The developer agents collaborate, with the Coding Agent executing the build tasks.
*   The code is stored in the third layer of the long-term memory: **Codebase knowledge.**
*   The dependencies and environment settings are stored in the fourth layer: **Stack and dependencies documents.**

**Monitoring Agent:** (Verbose output to the front-end)
"The developer agents have finished building the prototype. It is now ready for you to view and interact with."

**Orchestrator:** "Here is a link to the prototype of the AI writing assistant. Please try it out and let me know what you think. Your feedback will help us to refine the solution."

***Behind the Scenes:***
*   The Orchestrator provides the user with a link to the rendered prototype (e.g., a Streamlit or Next.js app hosted via E2B).

This example illustrates the sophisticated and autonomous nature of the proposed system. The Orchestrator manages the overall conversation and workflow, while specialized agents, operating within their respective graphs, handle specific tasks. The Monitoring Agent provides transparency, and the layered memory system ensures that all information is captured and utilized effectively. The back-and-forth between the user and the system allows for continuous refinement and a truly personalized solution.

Knowing these are what we have already built you must consider build on these and refactor them on the way - do these gradually and I will test on front end as you build, you don't have to rush in one go
